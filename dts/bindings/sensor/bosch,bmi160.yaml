description: |
    This is a representation of the BMI160 Inertial measurement unit

compatible: "bosch,bmi160"

include: spi-device.yaml

properties:
    int-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        This property specifies the connection for INT1, because the
        Zephyr driver maps all interrupts to INT1.  The signal defaults
        to output low when produced by the sensor.
